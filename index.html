        <h2>My Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
            I believe fitness is more than just physical appearance; it's about building a balanced and healthy
            lifestyle that
            strengthens both the body and mind. Consistency, patience, and mindfulness are at the core of my approach. I
            focus
            on listening to my body, embracing progress, and making exercise a sustainable, enjoyable part of daily
            life.
        </p>
        <h2>My Goals</h2>
        <p>
            My fitness goals are centered around building strength, improving flexibility, and enhancing overall
            mobility. I aim
            to master bodyweight exercises, perfect my handstands, and develop a deeper connection with yoga.
            Ultimately, I
            strive to create a well-rounded routine that keeps me energized, injury-free, and continuously improving.
        </p>
        <h2>Workout Tips</h2>
        <p>
            1. <strong>Start small and stay consistent:</strong> Even 10-15 minutes a day can make a big difference over
            time.<br>
            2. <strong>Focus on form:</strong> Proper technique is key to avoiding injuries and getting the most out of your
            workouts.<br>
            3. <strong>Prioritize recovery:</strong> Stretch, foam roll, and get enough sleep to allow your muscles to recover
            and grow.<br>
            4. <strong>Set achievable goals:</strong> Break down larger goals into smaller milestones to track your
            progress.<br>
            5. <strong>Find what you enjoy:</strong> Whether itâ€™s yoga, strength training, or calisthenics, doing what you love
            will keep you motivated.
